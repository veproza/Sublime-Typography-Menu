# Sublime Typography Menu

A simple Sublime Text 3 plugin to insert typographical characters (like dashes or ellipsis) from the command palette. Based heavily on the [Emoji plugin](https://github.com/ethanal/SublimeEmoji).

## Installation

Clone this repository into your `Packages` directory.

I will submit this to Package Control if enough people tell me to :-)

## Usage

Run ``Insert Typography`` in the command palette and select the character to insert at the cursor(s).

## List of insertables

Edit `typography-data.tsv` to add od remove special characters. It is a tab-separated list, first field is the character, second is the title to be shown in the command palette.

Pull requests are welcome!

## Thanks

[Ethan Lowman](https://github.com/ethanal) for the [Sublime Emoji plugin](https://github.com/ethanal/SublimeEmoji), on which this plugin is based.
